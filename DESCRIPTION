Title: d13carbulate - Calculate d13C Signature for Carbonate Species in a Water Samples
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Pieter J. K. Aukes
Maintainer: PJKA <paukes@uwaterloo.ca>
Description: This package calculates the d13C signature for all dissolved carbonate species within
    a water sample (CO2(aq), HCO3-, and CO3--) from pH, total DIC concentration, water temperature,
    and concentrations of the carbonate species. Check out the other package 'carbulate' to calculate
    concentrations for all dissolved carbonate species (from DIC, pH, and water temperature).
